Overview
========

Five Hundred is a card game for four players similar to Euchre or Bridge. It is especially popular in Australia and New Zealand.

This cross-platform Qt implementation has both an interactive mode and a non-interactive scriptable mode. Computer players can be implemented in Lua script and pitted against one another.

Five Hundred is developed by Oliver Giles and can be downloaded from its website at <http://fivehundred.sf.net>


Installation
============

Ubuntu/Debian GNU/Linux:
  Download the appropriate .deb file for your architecture. Use your graphical client to install or execute from the command line:
  sudo dpkg -U /path/to/downloaded/fivehundred.deb
  sudo apt-get install -f

Microsoft Windows:
  Download the installer executable and launch it

Mac OS X:
  Download the disk image and mount it. Drag the Five Hundred app file to your Applications folder


Compiling from source
=====================

You will need g++ >= 4.6 or another compiler with C++0x support. You will need headers and libraries for Lua >= 5.1 and Qt >= 4.6.

$ mkdir -p fivehundred/build
$ svn co https://fivehundred.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fivehundred/trunk fivehundred/trunk
$ cd fivehundred/trunk
  # At this point you may need to point CMake to Lua5.1 and Qt
$ cmake ../trunk -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make


Writing AI files
================

Five Hundred automatically reads all .lua files in its scripts folder. This folder can typically be found in
  ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/fivehundred/scripts on Linux-based systems
  %ProgramFiles%/Five Hundred/scripts on Microsoft Windows systems
  /Applications/Five Hundred.app/Resources/scripts on Mac OS X systems

Read Jed.lua for further documentation on creating AI scripts. Contact me if you're interested in releasing them in subsequent releases of Five Hundred.
